I am a designer who eventually turned towards coding. Well there is famous idiom which says:

> A picture is worth a thousand words.

I work on communicating as much as possible by design and use less words or numbers for that matter.

I am also an analyst who makes visualizations, making it easier for people to understand the data.

Well, have a look at my projects which will definitely tell you much better about me.
